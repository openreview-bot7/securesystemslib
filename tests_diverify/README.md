# DiVerify Evaluation Guide

This guide provides instructions for me to set up and evaluate the DiVerify project using `securesystemslib`, Sigstore's local infrastructure (Fulcio CA, Rekor, and CTLog).

The experiment is run on a host with **SGX capability**.

---

## Components Needed
1. `securesystemslib` for signing and verification
2. Fulcio Certificate Authority for certificate issuance
3. CTLog for certificate logging
4. Rekor for signature logging
5. RSTUF for distribution of DiVerify policy

---

## Steps

### 1. Clone Repositories
I need to clone the following repositories to my home directory:

- **[securesystemslib](https://github.com/openreview-bot7/securesystemslib/tree/DiVerify)**
- **[rstuf](https://github.com/openreview-bot7/rstuf)**
- **[containerized_sigstore](https://github.com/openreview-bot7/sigstore_containerized)**

---

### 2. Set Up RSTUF
Follow [link](https://repository-service-tuf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/deployment/setup.html#service-setup) to set up RSTUF for the key ceremony.  
Then, add policy delegation and sign accordingly.

---

### 3. SGX & Enclave Requirements
`securesystemslib` and `fulcio` require enclaves for trusted signing and quote/QVL verification.  
**SGX must be properly configured** in the container.  
Follow this GitHub Gist [link](https://gist.github.com/openreview-bot7/a01bc84ecea6484123ef82c7ed78c7dd) for setup or use a custom base image I've pre-configured for SGX, such as the one in my Docker Compose file.

---

### 4. Deploy Infrastructure
- Deploy **Sigstore infra** and **securesystemslib** using the `docker-compose-deverify.yml` file in the `containerized_sigstore` directory.
- Deploy **rstuf** using `docker-compose.yml` in the `rstuf` directory.

---

### 5. Start PCCS Services
Inside the `securesystemslib` and `fulcio` containers, start the PCCS service:

```bash
cd /opt/intel/sgx-dcap-pccs/
node pccs_server.js &
```

---

### 6. Start Fulcio Service
Inside the `fulcio` container, start fulcio service:

```bash
cd /home/fulio-Div
./run.sh
```

---

### 7. Generate Local Root of Trust
We use `securesystemslib` for the client and verifier.  
To generate the local Sigstore infra root of trust, run:

```bash
python securesystemslib/diverify/util/generate_trusted_root.py
```

---

### 8. Start DiVerify Daemon and Run Tests
**Inside the `securesystemslib` container:**

- **Terminal 1**: Start the DiVerify daemon:
  ```bash
  cd /home/securesystemslib
  make clean && make && gramine-sgx ./diverify
  ```

- **Terminal 2**: Run the test scripts:
  ```bash
  cd /home/securesystemslib
  tests_diverify/run.sh
  ```

This runs tests across **three modes** and **three levels**.

## Errors / Issues

### Error: Failed to download target policy*.json
**Cause**: Policy not found or TUF policies expired.  
**Fix**: Need to resign and retry.
